The generation of MW constraints is driven by a global target off-shift density $\mathcal{D}$, which represents the minimum proportion of rest days required for each operator over the full scheduling horizon $\mathcal{H}$. These rest days are distributed over several randomly generated time intervals, subject to practical constraints: each interval has a minimum length of 3 days and a maximum length of $0.2 \times \mathcal{H}$. For each interval, the minimum and maximum numbers of rest days are defined through local density parameters $d_{\min}$ and $d_{\max}$, which specify the allowed proportion of rest days within the interval. These densities are sampled using Gaussian distributions $\mathcal{N}(d_{\min}, d_{\min}/4)$ and $\mathcal{N}(d_{\max}, d_{\max}/4)$, introducing variability in both the timing and duration of rest periods. MW constraints are generated for each operator until the total minimum number of required rest days reaches the global target.
